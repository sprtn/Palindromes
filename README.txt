A simple palindrome-project that should have been easier than I found it to be.
I encountered a bug when I used spaces and capitol letters... Which I only now figured out.
I forgot to make the input word lower case, so it would obviously return false
if the word you inputted had an upper case letter...

Nevermind, should be working now. Carry on miss sofie.
